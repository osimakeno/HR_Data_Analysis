This project is a comprehensive HR data analytics initiative aimed at understanding employee trends, workforce demographics, and attrition factors within an organization. The dataset, stored in MySQL, consists of multiple employee-related attributes such as age, job role, education, attrition status, work-life balance, promotions, and performance ratings. Using SQL queries, we analyze key HR metrics to derive actionable insights for HR decision-makers.
